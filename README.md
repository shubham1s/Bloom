# BLOOM_BETA

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
Project Idea - In this era of covid-19 pandemic health and fitness is the most important
concern for everyone , with the increasing death rate all around the world. We should
not take this topic lightly anymore. We noticed that body hygiene and overall fitness is
the key for us to be saved from this monster .


BLOOM - Fitness at one place has the following main objectives -
1. Easily accessible for everyone.
2. To provide complete transparency of facts and results to the user.
3. Act as a personalised fitness instructor for the user.
4. To help achieve the goal of the user no matter how difficult it would be.
5. Daily update of activities and changes the user is bringing into themselves.
6. No sugar coated lie in terms of health conditions for the user.
7. Affordable and best services throughout.
8. Customised suggestions to the users feeling indecisive about themselves.
9. Motivate the user to achieve their goals.

Business Model -
Freemium & In-App Purchases and Advertising
These three business models make up three of the most bankable business models for
apps. Freemium apps allow users to download the app for free but require a purchase
for upgrades and advanced features. This strategy works by dangling the basic version
of your app in front of your users until they are actively engaged enough to buy the
upgraded version of your app.

Future Plans -
● Providing detailed analysis for diagnosis
● goal to grow
● Premium features available at very low costs
● Predicting risks
